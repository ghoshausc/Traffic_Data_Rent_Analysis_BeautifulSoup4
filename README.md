Impact:
•	To choosing a place to stay, traffic situation and rents in the specific area are primarily important. This project helps deduce both these two factors with utmost ease.
•	A zipcode spans a big area with several streets. This project will help users compare between rents of different streets in the same zip. 
•	Users can check the ‘traffic safety of the zip code: data from the last 10 years when shown on plots will help them get a clear picture of the zip code’s commuter safety.
•	Differentiation :
•	Rents of apartment prices are already present on different websites but within a given zip code how the rents vary in various streets needs to be deduced by the user separately. This project clearly triggers that gap with the best authenticity because of double-checking of zip codes. 
•	Traffic data might be present but the same about the last 10 years makes the analysis more authentic and reliable. When plotted on graphs and with histograms(ages of victims with most deaths)give better coverage of traffic analysis within that area.
